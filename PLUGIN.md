# Endstops Monitor Plugin

## Description

This is a very simple demonstration for a DWC-only plugin (v3.4 and later). It lets users monitor the endstops interactively like in previous DWC versions. When loaded it creates a new "Endstops" tab on the Settings -> Machine page.

## Installation

Get the matching EndstopsMonitor ZIP file for your installed DWC version from the releases and upload it on the `Settings` -> `Plugins` -> `External Plugins` page.
Once installed, you can start it and as a consequence, a new tab item under `Settings` -> `Machine-Specific` should show up. There you can monitor the states of your endstops.
